=====================================

## Learning Objectives
1. The student will implement their own MVC web application
2. The student will practice the separation of concerns concepts through the MVC architectural pattern.

## Lecture Outline

### MVC
MVC is an architectural pattern used in web applications. 
MVC is extremely helpful when it comes to separation of concerns. 
This allows us to make changes to the front-end (view) without 
affecting the business logic or the routes. 

#### Model
The model holds the business logic. This is where
we will create new classes and "models" for any objects
we wish to use within our web application

#### View
This is our front-end. HTML and CSS is displayed on 
the views. In addition, on the View, we reference the "Model"
that was sent to the view from the controller. 

A really cool feature in Views is that we can display the information
from the model on the .cshtml page by using very basic C# syntax.
This "Razor Syntax" allows us to use foreach loops and if statements
to manipulate how to display the information sent from the controller. 


#### Controller

The controller is the routing part of MVC. A controller contains
Actions, that maps to specific views. Each unique action is it's own 
view page.
