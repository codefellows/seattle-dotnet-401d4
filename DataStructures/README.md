# Data Structures

## Structure

The `Data_Structures_And_Algorithms` folder structure should mimic what your Data_Structures_And_Algorithms repository should look like.

The structure should be as follows (please note that your `Data Structures and Algorithms` will be a repo, and not a folder):


```markdown
>> Data Structures and Algorithms (Repository Name)
>> >> assets (holds all of your whiteboard images)
>> >> Challenges (Holds all individual code challenges)
>> >> >> FizzBuzz (Name of Challenge Folder)
>> >> >> >> FizzBuzz Solution folder
>> >> >> >> >> Program.cs
>> >> >> >> FizzBuzz Unit Tests
>> >> >> >> >> TestCode.cs
>> >> >> >> FizzBuzz.sln
>> >> >> >> Readme.md (Challenge Overview)
>> >> Data Structures (Holds all implementations of standard data structures)
>> >> Readme.md (List all Challenges completed)

```

## Specs

### Assets
This should contain all the assets that you have for this repo. Assets could be images, static files, reference docs etc..

### Challenges
This Folder should contain all of the challenges (with tests) that you have completed through the course.

Your `README` for each Challenge should contain the following:
1. Summary of the Challenge
1. Image of your whiteboard solution. (This image should have been saved in your assets folder, and linked accordingly.)
1. Explanation of why you solved the probelm this way


### DataStructures
The Data Structures folder should contain a folder for each of the implementations 
you have created through the course. 

The `README` for *each* of the implementaton will be your own technical documenation for the implementation. 

Each Readme should contain the following:

1. Name of the Data Structure
1. What the data structure is (in your own words)
1. What is it used for? Why? 
1. Visual of what it looks like
1. References/Resources used

### README

1. Your `README` should contain a table of context that displays all of the challenges and Implementations completed so far. 
1. Line Item should be the Name of the challenge, or implementation and link to the respective `README`.
