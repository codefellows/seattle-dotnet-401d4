## What are data structures?
Data Structures and Algorithms are a way of organizing data in way that it will execute logically and efficiently to solve some problem.
They are more heavily used in interviews to test your knowledge on the CS fundamentals, as well as a great way to practice your analytical and problem solving skills. 

Data structures vary from your basic linked list all the way to your advanced graphs and trees. The most effective way to teach them is to emulate 
what you will encounter in an interview setting as well as practice with 'on the fly' challenges. 

Over the next few weeks, you will be partnered with another student and will be required to whiteboard out the challenge, and then go 
to your own personal IDE and code out the challenge. All your code will live on github, this is so that future employers can review 
your work and see what you are capable of. 
 
## What is the process?
We have the process fully documented for you:
1. Pair up with your assigned partner
1. Read/evaluate the whiteboard challenge for the day located in Canvas
1. Go to the whiteboard, and start following the [Workflow Document](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/Whiteboard_Workflow)
	- You may exclude the real code section for challenges, but not for mock interviews
1. Use the [pseudocode](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Pseudocode) guide to learn and understand the requirements when writing pseudocode. 
1. Code out your challenge in an IDE (independently)
1. Add both the coded out challenge and the whiteboard to your github repository as specified in the submission instructions of each challenge
1. Submit a PR to your repo with a note who you worked with as a comment. 

## Rules
1. Each student is **required** to turn in their own version of the assignment (no group submissions) 
1. If you or your partner are unavailable, speak with your instructor about resubmission and/or new group. 

## Big O
Big O is the calculation of efficiency of time and space when an algorithm runs

### Different Types
1. Big O-Mega
	- Best case efficiency
2. Big Theta
	- Average case efficiencey
3. Big O
	- worst case

	We will mostly be focusing on Big O in this class. We want you to determine both the time and the space efficiency for the worst case of each algorithm.

	We focus on worst case because if you plan for worst case, you will build a more efficient algorithm keeping the worst case in mind.
